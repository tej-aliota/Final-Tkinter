This is a cool video because it shows you how to make a really good looking weather application. It goes in depth and at a solid pace. The end product is also really asthetically pleasing
seeing as though it is only a 22 minute video. I also think the end product is something that could be worked on later for a project

This video is especailly helpful for our end product this semester which has to do with object oriented programming. It specifically shows us how to use tkinter in conjunction with classes
which is a major part of oop. This creater also has a whole series on this that build on each other which could really help if I decide to use this for the project. I also like how it includes
sliders, buttons, and inputs which are all different things that you can include in a widget. As well as showing how to change the color. It really just shows a solid foundation to build projects off of.

This is a great video because it feature three simple project that you can create in only a few minutes. These include a random number generator, coinflipper, and simple clock widget. These are all simple but look
nice and serve their function well.

This final tutorial helps because it shows a simple way to code a calendar into Tkinter which can be used for other projects. It is very simple but also serves it purpose well. I also like how the creatore
goes through all the steps on a notepad at the beginning to give an overview of what needs to be done.

I ended up making the number generator. It was simple but worked nice. Along the way I was also able to learn how to use vs code which was really fun and helpful in the long term.
